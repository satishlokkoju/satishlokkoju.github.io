As a Javascript lover, and doing data science as my full time job, TensorFlow JS is like a dream come through, now you can run lightweight ML models directly in the web browser and share them!

# Why TensorFlow JS
- there is no installation, users can access your model via web browser, you can share your machine learning capability by hosting it on the web
- allowing users to train a model with their data without first handling to you

# Let's begin
Open your favourite editor, create a new .html file (for example *tfjs.html*), and add the following code to your HTML file:

```
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Load TensorFlow.js -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@0.13.0"> </script>

    <!-- Place your code in the script tag below. You can also use an external .js file -->
    <script>
      console.log('hi, this works');
    </script>
  </head>

  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

Here we are importing version 0.13, you can get the latest version at [TensorFlow JS](https://js.tensorflow.org/#getting-started).
Save the HTML file, and open the file in a web browser (i'm using Google Chrome). Press *f12* for the developer's console and click on *Console* tab. You should see *hi, this works*, if you don't, refresh the page. In the *Console*, this is our *interactive session* just like Jupyter Notebook.

Lets declare a new model, a feed forward back propagation neural network call sequential.
```
const model = tf.sequential();
```
You will see *undefined* and its fine, you can use the variable *model*.

Lets add (feed forward) fully connected layers to our model:
```
model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 8, inputShape: [1]}));
model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 1, inputShape: [8]}));
```
Layers are building blocks for ML Model. Each layer performs a certain computation to transform its input to its output.

Next, lets specify the loss and the optimiser for the model to get some learning:
```
model.compile({loss: 'meanSquaredError', optimizer: 'sgd'});
```

Now we need some training data:
```
const xs = tf.tensor2d([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [5, 1]);
const ys = tf.tensor2d([1, 4, 9, 16, 25], [5, 1]);
```
[Tensor](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/0.13.0/#tensor) is the n-dimensional array that holds our data.

And time to fit our model:
```
model.fit(xs, ys, {epochs: 100, shuffle:true})
```

This time you will get a *promise*. as training takes time, *promise* allows you to have an inner function to run codes after the current function is completed. you can read more about [*promise*](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/promises).


After the model has finish training, predict some values with:
```
model.predict(tf.tensor2d([2], [1, 1])).print();
console.log(model.predict(tf.tensor2d([6], [1, 1])).dataSync());
```
*.predict* will return a Tensor, *print()* is a TFJS function that prints the value in a Tensor, and *dataSync()* returns the Float32Array.

So, this is the '*hello world*' of TFJS, check out [TFJS documentation](https://js.tensorflow.org).

      model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 1, inputShape: [8]}));

      // Prepare the model for training: Specify the loss and the optimizer.

      const ys = tf.tensor2d([1, 4, 9, 16, 25], [5, 1]);

      // Train the model using the data.
      model.fit(xs, ys, {epochs: 1000, shuffle:true}).then(() => {
        // Open the browser devtools to see the output
        model.predict(tf.tensor2d([1], [1, 1])).print();
        model.predict(tf.tensor2d([2], [1, 1])).print();
        model.predict(tf.tensor2d([3], [1, 1])).print();

        model.predict(tf.tensor2d([6], [1, 1])).print();

      });
