# Important units of knowledge 


## What curse of dimensionality

## What is law of large number

## What is MLE

## How do you define eigen vectors and eigen values.


## Discuss the curse of dimensionality in detail ?


### What is deep Metric learning ?
  Deep Metric learning is a group of techniques used to measure the similarity of different data samples. The goal of metric learning is to learn a 
  representation that maps objects into embedding space. The distance in the embedded space should preserve the objects similarity.
  Contrasive loss and triplet loss are two popluar loss functions.



### What is contrasive loss ?
  The idea of contrasive loss is to design a loss function that pulls the representations (of images for example) close together for similar images
  and push them apart the dissimilar images 


### What is datacentric AI
  

### What is sensitivity ?

### What is AUC, ROC ?

### What is specivity ?

### What is the intution behing MobileNets
  The big idea behind mobilenets is to use the depthwise seperable convolutions to build light weight deep neural networks.
