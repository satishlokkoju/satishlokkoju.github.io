### What is the curse of dimensionality?

As the number of dimensions (features) in a dataset increases, the volume of the space increases exponentially. This requires exponentially more data points to maintain the same density, making statistical analysis and machine learning more challenging. High-dimensional data often leads to overfitting and computational complexity issues.

### What is the law of large numbers?

The Law of Large Numbers states that as the sample size increases, the sample mean approaches the population mean. In other words, with a large enough sample, the observed average will be close to the expected value. This is fundamental to statistical inference and probability theory.

### What is MLE?

Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is a method for estimating the parameters of a statistical model. It works by finding the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function, which measures how likely the observed data would be under different parameter settings. MLE is widely used in statistical modeling and machine learning.

### How do you define eigenvectors and eigenvalues?

An eigenvector of a linear transformation is a non-zero vector that changes only in scale (not direction) when that linear transformation is applied to it. The scalar factor by which the eigenvector is scaled is the eigenvalue. Mathematically, if A is a square matrix, v is an eigenvector, and λ is the corresponding eigenvalue, then: Av = λv.

### Discuss the curse of dimensionality in detail?

The curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing data in high-dimensional spaces that do not occur in low-dimensional spaces. As dimensions increase:

1. The volume of the space increases exponentially, requiring exponentially more data points
2. Distance metrics become less meaningful as points tend to be equidistant from each other
3. Data becomes sparse, making it harder to find patterns
4. Computational complexity increases dramatically
5. Risk of overfitting increases

These issues impact machine learning algorithms, especially those that rely on distance calculations or require sufficient data density.

### What is deep Metric learning?

Deep Metric learning is a group of techniques used to measure the similarity of different data samples. The goal of metric learning is to learn a representation that maps objects into embedding space. The distance in the embedded space should preserve the objects' similarity. Contrastive loss and triplet loss are two popular loss functions.

Deep metric learning typically uses neural networks to create embeddings where semantically similar objects are close to each other and dissimilar objects are far apart. This is particularly useful for face recognition, image retrieval, and recommendation systems.
